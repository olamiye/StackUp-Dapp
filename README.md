# StackUp Smart Contract

This repository contains a Solidity smart contract implementation of the StackUp Platform.

StackUp is a developer friendly platform that enables developers to level up, grow and connect with a global Dev community â€“ all while being rewarded for their time

## Features

- Quest Creation: The admin can create quests by specifying the title, reward, number of rewards, start time, and end time.
- Player Interaction: Players can join quests, submit their quest achievements, and view their quest status.
- Quest Review Functionality: The admin can review player submissions and approve or reject them.
- Quest Start and End Time: Each quest has a designated start and end time. Players can only join quests that have started and are still ongoing.

## Getting Started

To use the StackUp contract, follow these steps:

1. Install the required dependencies: [Solidity](https://soliditylang.org/).
2. Deploy the contract on a compatible Ethereum network.
3. Interact with the contract using a compatible Ethereum wallet or development environment.

## Usage

Here are some examples of how to interact with the contract:

1. Creating a Quest:
   - Call the `createQuest` function as the admin, providing the required parameters such as title, reward, number of rewards, start time, and end time.
   
2. Joining a Quest:
   - Call the `joinQuest` function as a player, providing the quest ID of the desired quest to join.
   - Make sure the quest has started and has not yet ended.
   
3. Submitting a Quest:
   - Call the `submitQuest` function as a player, providing the quest ID and a description of the quest achievement.
   - Make sure the quest is still ongoing.
   
4. Reviewing Submissions:
   - Call the `reviewSubmission` function as the admin, providing the submission index and indicating approval or rejection.
   
Please note that additional error checking and input validation may be required based on your specific implementation.

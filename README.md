# StackUp Smart Contract

This repository contains a Solidity smart contract implementation of the StackUp Platform.

StackUp is a developer friendly platform that enables developers to level up, grow and connect with a global Dev community â€“ all while being rewarded for their time

## Features

- Quest Creation: The admin can create quests by specifying the title, reward, number of rewards, start time, and end time.
- Player Interaction: Players can join quests, submit their quest achievements, and view their quest status.
- Quest Review Functionality: The admin can review player submissions and approve or reject them.
- Quest Start and End Time: Each quest has a designated start and end time. Players can only join quests that have started and are still ongoing.

## Getting Started

To use the StackUp contract, follow these steps:

1. Install the required dependencies: [Solidity](https://soliditylang.org/).
2. Deploy the contract on a compatible Ethereum network.
3. Interact with the contract using a compatible Ethereum wallet or development environment.
